# cdm-iiif-citation-generator
Generic citation generator using IIIF JSON manifest for CONTENTdm. No longer developed as of 9/2021. Since CONTENTdm at that time did not have a citation generator, I pulled IIIF manifest information and displayed it below the item metadata.

As referenced in Code4Lib journal article, "Citation Needed: Adding Citations to CONTENTdm Records" at https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/16289.
